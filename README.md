# Volume of a Sphere

The volume v of a sphere with radius r is given by:
> v = 4/3πr^3

Write a short program to calculate the volume of a sphere with radius 5. You can approximate the value of π as 3.14. 

## Solution
A sample solution is given in volumeOfaSphere.py. The script can be run as follows:

> $ python3 volumeOfaSphere.py
>
> The volume of the sphere is 523.3333333333334
